# Supervised Machine Learning Models

I have explored some machine learning models in this repository. I built a SVM classifier for breat caser dataset. The respective code can be found in the SVM Classifier folder.

The linear rgession model for house pricing dataset can be found in the Linear Regression Model folder. Lastly I use neural networks to build a model for house pricin dataset the code of which can be found in neural networks folder.
